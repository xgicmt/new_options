#Created using options for the [bloc.io] full stack develepent camp.

##Skip Test::Unit files  (Option -T)
I skipped this because we use Rspec testing, and all of the other rails apps we've created have also been without this option. 

##Skip Sprockets files (Option -S)
I skipped the sprockets files install because of all the extras that I didn't understand this one was the most confusing.  Also because the reinstall looks incredibly simple should we later find that we need it.
